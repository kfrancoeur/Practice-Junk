# Practice-Junk

This is a place to put all of my code produced while learning C#. Sorting will be as follows:

####By Chapter
I'm using Microsoft's _//Step by Step Microsoft Visual C#_ book as a basis.  If I pull a project straight from the book, it will be sorted into the chapter it came from.

####By Task
If I'm not pulling a project from the book, it will be based on what I'm intending to do with it.  For example: All sorting projects will be under a "Sorting" folder.
